	<h2>Class format</h2>
	<p>This unit is divided into three blocks:</p><ol><li><a href="#intro">Introduction to programming games</a>.</li><li><a href="#examples">Building games from components</a>.</li><li><a href="#cycle">The game development cycle</a>.</li></ol>	

	<h3 id="intro">Block 1: Introduction to programming games</h3>
	<p>In this block, each week:<ul>
	<li>we'll look at a new programming technique;</li>
	<li>we'll see how to apply it to a game program; and,</li>
	<li>you'll be given an exercise to test your understanding.</li></ul></p>
	
	<h3 id="examples">Block 2: Building games from components</h3>
	<p>In this block, each week:<ul>
	<li>we'll review an example game program; and,</li>
	<li>you'll begin to develop your game program for your assessment.</li></ul></p>
	
	<h3 id="cycle">Block 3: The game development cycle</h3>
	<p>In the final block, each week:<ul>
	<li>we'll examine the program development cycles; and,</li>
	<li>you'll continue the development of your game program.</li></ul></p>
	
	<h2>Dyslexia and learning difficulties</h2>
	<p><ul>
	<li>Make sure you have contacted Disability & Dyslexia Support (DDS).</li>
	<li>Programming is particularly hard on your eyes.</li>
	<li>The programs we're using in this unit are customisable for font and background colour.</li>
	<li>Whether you have dyslexia or not, configuring your system can reduce eye strain.</li>
	<li>The font we'll use in programming is <span class="citation">Microsoft Consolas</span>.</li>
	<li>If you prefer to change the font, ensure that it clearly distinguishes the following characters:<ul>
		<li>1 I l |</li>
		<li>0 O</li>
		<li>' "</li>
		<li>: ;</li>
		<li>. ,</li>
		<li>() {} [] &lt;&gt;</li></ul></li></ul></p>

	<h2>Source control</h2>
	<p><ul>
	<li>Source control is a database for your program files.</li>
	<li>All of your exercises and game programs should be developed and submitted through our source control system.</li>
	<li>The source control system we are using in this unit is called <span class="citation">subversion</span>.</li>
	<li>Our server is hosted by <span class="citation">Google Code</span>.</li>
	<li>Your introductory class will cover this system and how to use it.</li></ul></p>
	
	<h2>Exercises</h2>
	<p><ul>
	<li>In block 1, you are expected to complete one exercise a week.</li>
	<li>The purpose of each exercise is to demonstrate your understanding of the topic covered in the class.</li>
	<li>Exercises should not take long to complete: if you're quick you can complete them during the class; if you get stuck for more than a few minutes on one of the exercises, ask for help.</li></ul></p>
	
	<h2>Game program</h2>
	<p>In blocks 2 and 3:<ul>
	<li>You will create a small game program.</li>
	<li>Your program should demonstrate your understanding of the programming methods covered in class.</li>
	<li>As with the exercises, this should not consume a significant portion of your time and may be completed during class time.</li></ul></p>
	
	<h2>Assessment</h2>
	<p>Your exercises and game programs will be marked on:<ul>
	<li>how well you demonstrate your understanding of the topics covered in class; and,</li>
	<li>consistent application of the covered programming principles.</li></ul></p>
